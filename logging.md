# Logging

## Quick start

1. Choose a channel with \`!log channel &lt;\#channel&gt;\`
2. Select which events you want logged with \`!log &lt;event&gt;\` where event is an event found at the bottom of this page
3. Split up logging into separate channels by using the commands found below

{% hint style="info" %}
The command !log aio automatically creates a category, fills it with five channels and splits up logging into them.
{% endhint %}
