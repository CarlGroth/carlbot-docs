| Name | Example | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **suggestion channel \[\#channel\]** | !suggestion channel \#cool-server-feedback | Sets a channel as the suggestion channel or creates a new one if you don't mention one. |
| **suggestion dm** | -- | Toggles between sending the person who suggested something upon a moderator deciding on it. |
| **suggestion limit &lt;number&gt;** | -- | The color of the approved/denied suggestions are based on the difference in upvotes and downvotes on the original post. This threshold is the amount of votes required for the decision to be fully green/red. |
| **suggestion move \[\#channel\]** | -- | This will let you set a secondary channel to announce the suggestions that admins have approved/denied. Just like !suggestion channel this can be left blank to create a channel. |
